## Project Recipe


1. Project Initialization and Home Screen Design:

- I initiated a new React project using TypeScript.
- Developed a home screen with signin button and integrated social media handles for our company.

2. Sign-In Page with Tamagui Effects:

- Executed the development of the sign-in page using Tamagui, implementing the sheet concept for a visually appealing effect.
- Utilized Tamagui to embed toast logic for authentication feedback. Users receive a pop-up message ('Hey, please enter valid credentials') if they fail to enter the correct username and password.

3. Dashboard Feature Implementation with Tamagui Cards and Pagination:

- Developed the dashboard screen, with 'Dashboard' as title.
- Fetched a list of posts & its comments from Posts API, Comments API URL's
- List of post and comments displayed on dashboard in form of cards.
- List of posts are paginated to show 10 records with an ability to move to next/previous page
- Utilized Tamagui's theme-card concept to embed one post and its corresponding comments in a single card.
- Implemented pagination with page number buttons, preventing endless scrolling.

5. Enhanced User Experience with Special Navbar:

- Designed a special navbar on the dashboard for a better user experience.
- Included the developer's social media handles and the dashboard title in the navbar.
- Implemented a logout button, redirecting the user to the home page upon clicking.

5. Repository Creation, and Deployment:

- Created a separate repository on GitHub.
- Deployed the project on Vercel, ensuring accessibility from anywhere, anytime.


## Issue faced
- Addressed the difficulty of preventing direct access to the dashboard page without proper sign-in, but i will work on it.
